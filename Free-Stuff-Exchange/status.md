# A website that would allow Harvard students to trade free stuff.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project is a web based exchange platform that allows students to fully utilize their time at Harvard by maximizing the amount of free stuff that they can collect in four years.
This project will have 1 database that has several tables for storing items and user account information.
The website may even include a geolocation feature that help students geolocate sources of free stuff. But most importantly our website will connect students with each other and allow them to exchange the free stuff that they have accumulated.
Web's motto: "One man's trash is another man's treasure.
We intend to host this website through flask and the CS50 IDE. We want our model to be based in SQLlite3, and we will use Python to write the controller for the website.
For View, we intend to use a pre-made open-source template (i.e. through bootstrap)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?



Hey can you read this?

I am on the second floor of the hackathon






Baseline goal:  - SQL database: username, password, name, year, dorm, stuff they offer (text), stuff they want (text), email
                - Python-based server using microframework Flask
                - Pages:
                    + index.html (user's homepage)
                    + layout.html
                    + login.html
                    + register.html
                    + form.html (to submit an item that user wants to trade onto platform.html for others to see)
                    + history.html (historical record of past items traded away and received from what users)
                    + request.html (to submit a request for an item)
                    + platform.html (to allow users to scroll through a list of items currently available)
                - View:
                    + Use pre-made template (e.g. https://html5up.net/)
                    + Incorporate Javascript
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Better goal 1: Pictures
Better goal 2: User 1 can request for stuff that is not yet in the database and they will get an email when another User 2 lists a similar item.
Better goal 3: When events with Free stuff happens, make an alert via email to users


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best Goal: Search Bar (dynamic like with Facebook's search bar)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Learning Goal 1: The google photos API: https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/overview
                    for storing pictures of items
Learning Goal 2: Map API
Learning Goal 3: Search Bar
Our first step is to open up the cs50 ide and create the initial frame work of our website. We will look to first effectively incorporate features from finance, and then we will improve upon and adapt them for our website's purpose.
We will dig deeper into the design and database features in finance, in the process learning new things about SQL and javascript. Building upon finance may be our entire project, as we do not know how long it will to fully understand and implement the elements of design featured in the project.
By building upon finance we will improve our web development skills. After we are done with the bare minimum, we will work on the aesthetic and design of our website, hopefully learning new things about css and html.
Our stretch goals may require that we learn google photos API to store images, and cloudinary to store other data.
Our super stretch goals may require a mapping API. We will need to do more research if we arrive at this point.
Because we are working in a two-person group, we should be able to work on the same thing at the same time. This approach will work best because it will allow us to learn more from the project by discussion of the shared software obstacles.
